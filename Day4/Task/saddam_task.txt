Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently

To master version control
techniques, it's important to
follow best practices when using
Git Revert and Git Reset. Always
create a backup branch before
making significant changes, and
communicate with the team to
ensure everyone is aware of the
modifications.
