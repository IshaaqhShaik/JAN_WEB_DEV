Generating a new SSH key and adding for Mac

1. Open Terminal
2. Paste the text below, replacing the email used in the example with your GitHub email address.
   {ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"}
3. This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label.
4. First, check to see if your ~/.ssh/config file exists in the default location.

   $ open ~/.ssh/config
  > The file /Users/YOU/.ssh/config does not exist.
5. If the file doesn't exist, create the file.
    touch ~/.ssh/config
6. ssh-keygen -t ed25519- "your_email@example.com"

Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account

1. Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.
   If your SSH public key file has a different name than the example code, modify the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key, don't add any newlines or whitespace.
   $ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   # Copies the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard
  Tip: If pbcopy isn't working, you can locate the hidden .ssh folder, open the file in your favorite text editor, and copy it to your clipboard.
 
2. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
3. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  SSH and GPG keys.
    Click New SSH key or Add SSH key.
4. In the "Key" field, paste your public key.
   Click Add SSH key.
